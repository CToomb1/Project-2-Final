# Project-2-Final
We chose to do an employee work scheduling app for our project
We used different db links to create tables for different employees and shifts and which employees had which shifts 
We also created a way that when entering an employee (first name and last name) to the website, their role in the company could also be entered (manager, barista, etc)
We used different routes to ensure the flow of data from page to page and from db to page 
We created 3 different pages, for the website to show employees' names and their roles with the option to create more, a page that showed available shifts with the option to modify and create more as well as a way to assign employees to shifts, and a page to check which employees had which shifts
